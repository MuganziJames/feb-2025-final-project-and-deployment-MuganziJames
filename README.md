## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository houses a frontend-only static site designed as a final showcase of interactive UI elements, responsive layouts, and deployment best practices. It's the digital stage for my February 2025 milestone, combining crisp visuals, sleek animations, and modular code organization.

## 🔥 Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.
- **Interactive Components**: Engaging buttons, modals, and image galleries powered by vanilla JavaScript.
- **Custom Animations**: Smooth transitions using CSS keyframes and JavaScript event hooks.
- **Modular Structure**: Organized file system (`css/`, `js/`, `pages/`) for maintainability.
- **Automatic Deployment**: Every push to `main` triggers a fresh build on Vercel.

## 💡 JavaScript Concepts Highlighted

1. **DOM Manipulation**  
   Selecting and modifying elements in the Document Object Model to create dynamic UI changes (e.g., toggling classes for theme switchers, updating content on user actions).

2. **Event Delegation**  
   Efficiently handling multiple similar events by listening at a higher-level ancestor, reducing listener overhead and improving performance.

3. **Asynchronous Operations**  
   Using Promises and `fetch` API to load external JSON or simulate data retrieval—demonstrated in interactive galleries or form handling.

4. **Module Pattern**  
   Encapsulating code into self-contained modules (IIFEs or ES6 modules) that expose only necessary methods and keep the global namespace clean.

5. **Debouncing and Throttling**  
   Controlling the frequency of event-driven functions (e.g., scroll or resize handlers) to optimize responsiveness without overwhelming the browser.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Semantic markup for accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS3** – Flexbox, Grid, and custom variables for theming.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Modern syntax with `let`/`const`, arrow functions, and modules.
- **Vercel** – Zero-config deployments for static sites.

## 🏁 Quick Start

1. **Clone Locally**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MuganziJames/feb-2025-final-project-and-deployment-MuganziJames.git
   cd feb-2025-final-project-and-deployment-MuganziJames
   ```
2. **Open in Browser**  
   Double-click `index.html` or serve using a simple HTTP server:
   ```bash
   npx serve .
   ```
3. **Explore & Tinker**  
   - Modify `css/styles.css` for custom theming.  
   - Tweak `js/main.js` to add or refine interactive behaviors.  
   - Add new pages under `pages/` and link them from the nav.

## 🚀 Deployment Workflow

- Every merge into `main` triggers Vercel to:
  1. Clone the updated repo.
  2. Build (if necessary) and deploy to a global CDN.
  3. Invalidate cache and publish changes within seconds.
